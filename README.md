# Recommendation-Systems
Using Cosine similarity, we try to club those movies that the user might be interestedin and recommend the same to the user. The way it is done is that we take previous movie ratings of the users and try to find the genre and type of movies that might be nearest in terms of likelihood of liking according to user.
